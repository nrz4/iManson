							<p><strong>Charles Manson</strong> has remained a riveting figure in American and Californian culture for over five decades. Thanks to his performing skills, Manson had the world flabbergasted and attentive to anything surrounding his name. This has led people to create music about him or even mention him. They made gruesome films of the murders taking place with a splash of Tarantino magic. Problematic beliefs were highlighted during that time, and a good amount of progress was made. And many, many more that I will highlight within iManson.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/code1.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I want to start off by stating why I chose the name of this website and why I have organized it this way. Charles Manson influenced our American culture, which still remains today. iManson is a way to connect Charles Manson with this modern-day era we live in. The code describes that I will first place artistic topics (music, film, landscape) and cultural issues (mansonistas, interviews, race and racism) after.</p>

								<h3>Freak by Lana Del Rey</h3>
								<p></p>
								<p>This song does not go into depth on anything about Charles Manson. This song talks about the ups and downs of gangster life. However, one bar references him and highlights how he is perceived. Ice Cube, an American rapper, actor, and filmmaker, raps, "Here's a murder rap to keep yo dancin; With a crime record like Charles Manson." When he states this, he references the number of murders Charles Manson has made the girls commit. Referencing himself to Manson show how he wants to be perceived as murderous and savage, just like Manson. We can see two different instances in which Lana del Rey wants to be AROUND Manson, and Ice Cube wants to BE Manson.</p>

								<h3>Bloodbath in Paradise by Ozzy Osbourne</h3>
								<p></p>
								<p>Ozzy Osbourne, the English singer, songwriter, and television personality, go into depth about Manson and his family's murders. In his song, different verses revealed different topics surrounding the murders, such as the bloody 'pig' on the wall, the California environment, and how they execute their creepy crawlies at night. Ozzy places this song into the history of California, specifically 1969, where it was abrupt, as Joan Didion described, "[the] precise moment [when] the Sixties came to an end." Using these topics and this placement in history, he can emphasize his song's purpose and tone, which is spine-chilling, paranoia, and sinister.</p>

								<h3>Cease To Exist by Charles Manson</h3>
								<p></p>
								<p>Charles Manson befriended Dennis Wilson, which allowed him to make and produce this song. However, we can also see how The Beach Boys took this song and renamed it 'Never Learn Not to Love.'</p>

								<h3>Never Learn Not To Love by The Beach Boys</h3>
								<p></p>
								<p>Looking at this song and 'Cease to Exist, ' we can instantly see the similarity between the two. However, within this version, we see a positive spin on the lyrics changing them from mundane to uplifting. This stark contrast shows how The Beach Boys or Dennis Wilson attempted to escape the Charles Manson aura within this song.</p>

								<p>Manson has made a big influence in film right after the murders occurred and within the 21st century.</p>

								<!--Once Upon A Time... in Hollywood-->
								<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7131622/">Once Upon a Time in... Hollywood(2019)</a></h3>
								<p></p>
								<p>This movie is about a famous television actor and his stunt double striving for success within the rapidly changing Hollywood film industry. Since this took place in 1969 in Los Angeles, it was also the same time period the Manson events occurred. When Quentin Tarantino made this film, he wanted to place these characters that are going through these historical events of film and murder. However, being Mr. Tarantino, he added his own signature spice to the movie, and instead, the ‘murderers’ were murdered by the stunt double. This film has made Charles Manson and his family engraved into the history of 1969, brought it out even more to this day within his own movie, and added his own Tarantino trademark.</p>

								<!--Charlie Says-->
								<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1759744/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Charlie Says(2018)</a></h3>
								<p></p>
								<p>This film makes three of the Manson girls the main characters. Throughout modern history, people have been highlighting the misogyny and patriarchal society we currently live in. Producers made the girls the main characters to clap back at these certain ideals and talk about their lives through their perspective instead of the good ol’ Charles Manson trials. Through their lenses, we see how their minds are brainwashed with homophobic and chauvinistic ideals. This brainwashing is challenged by the counselor that gives these girls college-level classes. The exposure to education highlights the lack of independent thinking the girls possessed and even makes Susan Atkins go through a breakthrough of finally thinking for herself. This movie accentuates the clash of modern and past beliefs in American society.</p>

								<!--Helter Skelter-->
								<h3><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074621/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_2">Helter Skelter(1976)</a></h3>
								<p></p>
								<p>The Helter Skelter movie was made around 7 years after the murders occurred. Although the murders were new then, this didn’t stop producers from making entertainment out of it. The first part of the film premiered on CBS on Thursday, April 1, 1976, with a Nielsen rating of 35.2 and an audience share of 57%, making it the most-watched made-for-TV movie ever. At the time of its broadcast, the average household share made it the eleventh-highest-rated film to air on network television, and as of 2003, it is ranked 16th. These statistics show how the American mindset is okay with using other people’s suffering as entertainment. It is an ideal that can still be seen today.</p>

								<p>On September 26, 1970, a wildfire destroyed the Spahn Movie Ranch's film sets and residential structures. The California state purchased the site and placed it within California's Santa Susana Pass State Historical Park within the "Devil's Slide" section. It is interesting to see how Charles Manson and his family placed a negative image on the landmark after years and after all of their remains had been burned away. This placement shows the impact Manson made on American and Californian soil.</p>

								<p>When actress Sharon Tate was killed on August 9, 1969, she was eight months pregnant. The home she was at, 10055 Cielo Drive, was demolished in the 1990s; Jeff Franklin, the creator of Full House, now owns the new home on the property, which has a different house number. Following the murders, the property owner changed the address from 10050 Cielo Drive to 10066 Cielo Drive to both attract a new buyer and prevent the area from being perceived as a gothic attraction.</p>

								<p>In 1969, Leno LaBianca, the head of a chain of supermarkets, and his wife Rosemary, the owner of a prosperous clothing company, were brutally murdered inside their home. Although the house is still standing, the address has changed. Call it morbid interest or clever real estate strategies, but the house sold in 2021 for $1.875 million.

								<p>When Dennis Wilson picked up two Manson Family girls hitchhiking along the road, he took them to his home in Rustic Canyon, where they hung out before everyone left. He arrived back at his house that evening late to discover Charles Manson there along with about a dozen primarily female guests. For a few months, Manson and the visitors stayed there at Wilson's expense of $100,000. Zillow.com reports that the house is still standing but has undergone renovations. The house is currently not up for sale because someone owns it. Perhaps a Manson enthusiast?</p>

When we know the creator of these posts, it is all by one person named DebS, except for one. This leads to the website being focused on one perspective.

						<!-- Interviews -->
						<article id="interviews">
							<h2 class="major">Interviews</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mansoninterview.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Interviews were a place to shine for Charles Manson. Within this section, I explore how Charles Manson remains his same true self before, during, and after the murder case.</p>
							
							<!--Interview #1-->
							<h3><a href="https://www.mansondirect.com/brasil-interview.html">Interview #1</a></h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>In a 2012 interview with Brazil, Manson exhibits the same behavior as ever. ATWA is the primary subject of this interview (Air, Trees, Water, and Animals). He does not make any sense when responding to the interviewer's questions, and even when he does, it is odd that he is considering these kinds of issues. Even though he is still in the spotlight and a different subject is being discussed, he responds similarly. It demonstrates that Manson continues to feel mentally free regardless of the type of American prison institution he is locked up in.</p>

							<!--Interview #2-->
							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yM3zg0nJOj8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<h3>Interview #2</h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>This interview with Charles Manson occurred in 1972. From the beginning of the video, we hear someone in the back state, “Cameras rolling.” Although the action of interviewing is just enough, we see how Manson is being placed under the spotlight by all of these different types of media. An interview from a news outlet is essential because the person is usually significant or entertaining. Although the general society believes Manson is a murderer and deserves everything the court will give him, he still receives all the attention. This supports the American ideal that although we support, preach, and want to focus on the good, we focus on the bad instead.</p>

							<!--Interview #3-->
							<h3><a href="https://www.mansondirect.com/67interview.html">Interview #3</a></h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>This interview is unique from the others because it was conducted in 1967, two years before the killings. Consequently, we get to see a behind-the-scenes look at Manson before the negative press. He was in a recording studio when this interview took place, but despite the title "interview," it seemed more like a casual conversation between two friends. Once again, Charles Manson's responses to these queries are odd and occasionally illogical such as, “I believe it. I believe anything you say. You can never lie to me. I believe all. You’re perfect. You can never do any wrong. Anything you do is just— my goodness. Yeah, there are no mistakes.” This demonstrates how, in the end, Manson stays the same regardless of what the American government does next.</p>
						</article>

						<!-- Race and Racism -->
						<article id="racism">
							<h2 class="major">Race and Racism</h2>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mansonnazi.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Although these following few articles don't relate to Manson as much, it does say something about the racism that was common within this time period. 'Helter Skelter' is evil because a murderous cult leader stood behind it; however, this ideal stood behind racism which is something that almost every white American was guilty of.</p>

							<!--Harlem Gang-->
							<h3><a href="https://www.proquest.com/docview/115531135/9C66903BF1474B74PQ/1?accountid=10267">Whites Are Target of Harlem Gang</a></h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>Overall, this reading had a lot to say about love and hate, particularly how those two diametrically opposed feelings became the "sides" of the alleged race war. As a gang of young black men—possibly including kids as young as 12—caused hysteria by attacking and even killing white people, the article started to show how accurate the anger and violence were during this decade. However, since it is stated explicitly that police officers cannot release any information at this time, this is all just an allegation. The fact that they immediately blamed the Harlem "Blood Brothers" and painted them as gangsters and soldiers preparing to wipe out society serves as a stark reminder of the racism that prevailed at the time.</p>

							<!--Clever Soul-->
							<h3><a href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/45173/files/6310252?module_item_id=1645244">Cleaver Soul on Ice</a></h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>Based on the prevalence and even influence that racism had on Cleaver and other African American minds, it is clear from the story of a criminal that hatred and rage were at the heart of the terrible acts committed. We can see how this influence caused him to rape a white woman because he was enraged with them for brainwashing him to find them more alluring than black women. We can see two ideas expressed in this one instance: African Americans don't like white people, and their skin color doesn't attract them. Charles Manson may have carried out his own "solution" due to the intense racial tension.</p>

							<!--Trial #1-->
							<h3>Trial Trascripts <a href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/45173/files/6310285?module_item_id=1645246">Part I</a> and <a href="https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/45173/files/6310286?module_item_id=1645247">Part II</a></h3>
							<p></p>
							<p>The trial transcript of Lynette Fromme's testimony reveals how deeply she thought Manson comprehended the inner workings of this fear and the purported impending race war. Despite Lynette's claim that Manson "loved" black people, another witness, Ernest Shepard, appeared unsure when asked if Manson and he were pals in jail. It was very challenging to truly comprehend Manson's ideals and beliefs because everyone's interactions with him were unique. The notion of "Helter Skelter" as his motivation now seems less reliable.</p>
